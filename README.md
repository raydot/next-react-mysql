Following a Tutorial on using Next.js with React and mySql

Tutorial by SaidHayani@ and located at https://medium.freecodecamp.org/an-introduction-to-next-js-for-everyone-507d2d90ab54

Verdict: <strong>Got it working, although the tutorial is pretty poorly written.  For instance, the linking examples conflict with the scss examples.  Too bad, as I suspect it does the product a disservice.</strong>
